"benecurrit.py" README file

benecurrit makes sensible decisions about which directory entries (in
the path list "PATH" used to find commands) --we call such path entries
in a list 'pathels' for 'path elements'-- to keep, and which ones to
discard. benecurrit also finds architecture-specific (see uname (1))
directories under /usr/local and /opt on the x86 platform (TODO: extend
the detection to other possibilites) which have a "bin/" subdirectory,
and prepends such <ARCH>/bin pathels to the PATH list.

This program is offerred under the terms of the GPL v2 or later and no
warranty, express or implied, is given. The user assumes all risks and
responsibilities regarding execution of this code on her/his system.

benecurrit.py was first placed on github on Wed 01/26/2011 17:10 UTC
and may undergo significant developmental changes in the future.

The author is SÃ¶ren Andersen and can be reached at <somian ZERO-EIGHT
 -AT- gmail DotCom> ...the author was, at the time this program was
written, exerting himself to renew his rusty acquaintance with the
Python language and extend his knowledge of python. The goal was to
write a useful tool using python.

When starting a bash shell under the author's primary daily use
GNU/Linux desktop, running a Debian-like distro, the file ~/.bashrc is
used as a bash "init file". The .bashrc file the author uses contains
this line:

    PATH=$($HOME/bin/benecurrit.py 2>/dev/null)

Other uses of this program may suggest themselves to imaginative
persons. In general this is a tool written with code developers in mind.
